Consider the parameters of the model, what they represent, and whether the assumptions they represent are realistic.\nAnswer:\nS(t): The population decreases to a minimum at about 9 days but the birth of new susceptibles prevents it reaching 0. It will continue to increase to a stable equilibrium.\nI(t): The population increases to a peak and then the recovery process causes the population to decrease. The infectious population does not decrease down to 0 as before as the new susceptibles will get infected. The long-term behaviour is a stable equilibrium.\nR(t): The recovered population increases to a peak and then decreases to a stable equilibrium as the recovered population die and are replaced with susceptibles. There’s an implicit assumption in the model that transmission is not passed to newborns; i.e. only susceptibles are born. This is likely a reasonable assumption to make for many diseases. As we are dealing the proportion of the total population it’s reasonable to keep N(t) constant, but the birth and death rates may not be reasonable. Instead, we might be best to allow them to grow indefinitely (or, if the death rate is higher, decrease to 0).\nAdditionally, we assume that the entire population is capable of giving birth to newborns, and that the disease does not cause a loss of life expectancy."
