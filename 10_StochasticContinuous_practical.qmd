## A. SIR model from lecture

### A.1 Implement the SIR model from the slides and lot the proportion of the population that is infectious.

```{r, eval = F}
time_sir <- seq(0, 20, by = 1)

y_sir <- matrix(data = NA,
                nrow = length(time_sir),
                ncol = 3)

update_sir <- function(t, y, parms){
    beta  <- parms["beta"]
    gamma <- parms["gamma"]

    out <- ???

    return(out)
}

parms_sir <- c(beta = 1.3,
               gamma = 0.23)

# initial values at t=0

y_sir[1, ] <- c(???, ???, ???)

for (i in 2:nrow(y_sir)){
    y_sir[i,] <- ???
}

plot(x = time_sir, y = y_sir[,2])
```

A.1.(a) At approximately what time does the peak in infectious population occur and what proportion of the population is infectious?

A.1.(b) Approximately how long does it take for the susceptibles to go to 0?

### A.2 Change the mean time spent infectious from 4.35 days to 2 days, keeping the rate of transmission the same.

A.2.(a) At approximately what time does the peak in infectious population occur and what proportion of the population is infectious?

A.2.(b) Approximately how long does it take for the susceptibles to go to 0?

```{r, eval = F}
parms_sir <- c(beta = ???,
               gamma = ???)

y_sir[1, ] <- ???

for (i in 2:nrow(y_sir)){
    y_sir[i,] <- ???
}

plot(x = ???, y = ???, ylim = c(0,1))
```

### A.3 Change the mean time spent infectious back to 4.35 days and set the transmission rate to be half what is has been

A.3.(a) At approximately what time does the peak in infectious population occur and what proportion of the population is infectious?

A.3.(b) Approximately how long does it take for the susceptibles to go to 0?

```{r, eval = F}
parms_sir <- ???

y_sir[1, ] <- c(0.99, 0.01, 0)

for (i in 2:nrow(y_sir)){
    y_sir[i,] <- ???
}

plot(???)
```

## B. SIR model

### B.1 Incorporating births

Adapt the SIR model in the slides to incorporate birth of new susceptibles proportional to the sum of the S, I, and R populations. Balance these new births with deaths from each of the S I and R groups, with both the per capita birth and death rates being delta=0.01

```{r, eval = F}
new_sir <- function(t, y, parms){
	
    beta  <- parms["beta"]
    gamma <- parms["gamma"]
    delta <- parms["delta"]

    ??? <- ???
    ??? <- ???
    ??? <- ???    
    	
    return(???)
    
}

new_parms <- ???
```

### B.2 Visualising for the whole population

Calculate N(t) = S(t) + I(t) the total number of alive individuals. Make a plot of S(t), I(t), R(t) and N(t). Your function N(t) should be constant at 1 for all values of t. If this is not the case, ensure the model contains births of new S proportional to N, and deaths of each of S, I, and R.

```{r, eval = F}

y_sir <- cbind(y_sir, rowSums(y_sir))
par(mfrow = c(2,2))

for (i in 1:ncol(y_sir)){

    plot(y_sir[,i] ~ time_sir, type = "p", 
         xlab = "Time (years)")

}
```

B.2.(a) At approximately what time does the peak in infectious population occur and what proportion of the population is infectious?

B.2.(b) Approximately how long does it take for the susceptibles to go to 0?

### B.3 Discussion

Discuss what happens to the population of S, I, and R over time. Consider the parameters of the model, what they represent, and whether the assumptions they represent are realistic.
