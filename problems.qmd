title: "Modelling problems"
---

## Aim

When you are faced with a research question, and think that modelling might be useful, you have to translate the problem into a model.

As a modeler, you will have to choose the type of model you want to use, build the model and choose the parameters.

In this course, we have 3 sessions (Tuesday and Thursday) to enable you to think constructively about the type of model you might need for a research problem that we provide you with.

We are aiming for a "sketch" of a model or a few ideas of what a model would look like (e.g. compartment diagram). You are not required to code anything.

## Instructions

Tuesday's session (30 mins):

1.  Identify which group you are in and which modelling problem you should tackle (table **TBC**)
2.  Open your group's Modelling Problem (see below!)
3.  Take some time to look at the problem and ask any questions you need to (20 mins)
4.  Now you've had a chance to think about the problem yourself, you can say "Hi" to your group colleagues

Thursday's session: You'll be working with colleagues in your group to sketch a model that answers your particular question. After this group work, there will be a session to discuss the problem you had to solve, and your ideas for a solution with the other groups. You and your group can write down your ideas on draw.io (link **TBC**).
