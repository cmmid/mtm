## (1) One-way sensitivity analyses

First, let's run an ODE model. Download and open up the [SIRmodel.R](docs/functions/SIRmodel.R)

### (a) Which functions are in here?

Answer: `solveODE()` and `SIR_model()`

### (b) What are the arguments of the first function?

Answer: (1) the parameter values lists, (2) Argument to plot everything, (3) number of row to plot (4) number of cols to plot

### (c) What is the output of the first function?

Answer: maximum prevalence through the epidemic

``` r
# First let's clear our workspace, remove plots and load the libraries we need
rm(list=ls())
dev.off()
library(deSolve)
library(ggplot2)

# Let's read in these functions so we have them to hand
source("SIRmodel.R")

# Let's choose a beta value of 0.4 and a gamma value of 0.2
max.prevalence <- solveODE(parameters <- c(beta = 0.4, gamma = 0.2))
print(max.prevalence)

# Now let's look at the effect of the maximum prevalence of the epidemic across 
# gamma = 0.1 -1.0 (increment on 0.1)
gamma.vec <- seq(0.1, 1.0, by = 0.1)

# initialise max/prevalence container
max.prevalence <- vector()

# Add in a loop to make this happen
for (gamma.val in gamma.vec){
  mp = solveODE(parameters = c(beta = 0.4, gamma = gamma.val),
                                         plot.all.results = FALSE)
  max.prevalence = c(max.prevalence, mp)
}

# Now we have our max.prevalence, we need to plot this against our 
# infectiousness duration - plot max.prevalence as a function of the 
# \*infectiousness duration\*

par(new=FALSE)
par(mfrow=c(1,1))

plot(1/gamma.vec, 
     max.prevalence, 
     type = "b",
     xlab = "Infectiousness Duration (days)",
     ylab = "Maximum Prevalence",
     main = "One-way uncertainty analysis")

# Now try to increase the resolution of gamma to get a better idea of the 
# relationship but remember to clear max.prevalence first!

# You could try and replace gamma.vec = seq(0.1, 1.0, by = 0.1) with
inf.duration = 1:10
gamma.vec = 1/inf.duration
```

### (d) Describe in words the qualitative relationship

Answer: There is no epidemic until the infectiousness duration is \> 2 days (R0 \> 1) after that there is a linear increase in the maximum prevalence until gamma = 6, then there is a diminishing increase in the maximum prevalence.

## (2) Monte Carlo Sampling

Now suppose that we have a previous epidemiological study that suggested that R0 has a mean value of 5, but uncertainty within the range of \[-1, +1\]. However, we still don't know whether the infectiousness period is 1 day or 10 days. We will now use the functions in [SIRmodel_R0.R](docs/functions/SIRmodel_R0.R) to make a similar plot as above, but this time, incorporate the uncertainty of R0 for each discrete value of gamma. We're going to first use a direct Monte Carlo Sampling method.

``` r
# Read in our set of functions in SIRmodel_R0.R
source("SIRmodel_R0.R")

# First, let's set a fixed seed for the random number generator
# this will allow us to run the code again and retrieve the same 'simulation'
set.seed(2019)

# Now, draw R0 1,000 times from a suitable distribution (e.g. normal)
r0.all = rnorm(1000, 5, 0.5)
size.df = length(r0.all) * length(gamma.vec)

# initialise max.prevalence again, this time it needs to be a dataframe 
# or a matrix
max.prevalence = data.frame(r0.value = vector(mode = "numeric", 
                                            length = size.df),
                            gamma = vector(mode = "numeric", 
                                           length = size.df),
                            max.prev = vector(mode = "numeric", 
                                              length = size.df))
index = 0

# create a loop over each of these R0 values in turn
for (r0.val in r0.all){
# create a loop over each of these Gamma values in turn
    for (gamma.val in gamma.vec){
    index = index + 1
    mp = solveODE_2(parameters = c(R0 = r0.val, gamma = gamma.val))
    max.prevalence[index, "r0.value"] = r0.val
    max.prevalence[index, "gamma"] = gamma.val
    max.prevalence[index, "max.prev"] = mp
    }
}

# Take a look at max.prevalence by using the 'head() function
head(max.prevalence)
```

### (e) How have we saved the output?

Answer: using 'long' formatting -- see the ggplot pre-course material

``` r
Now plot this output using the R function MCplot() in SIRmodel_R0.R
MCplot(max.prevalence)
```

### (f) What conclusions can you draw from the plot?

Answer: Increasing the rate of recovery reduces the max prevalence. However, the uncertainty in R0 has a larger impact on the maximum prevalence than infectious duration. In fact, until the infectiousness duration decreases below 4 days, the value of R0 is the important parameter in determining prevalence.

## (3) Latin hypercube sampling (LHS) vs Monte Carlo Sampling

``` r
# First let's load in the library we'll need for later
library(lhs)

# We're going to first sample directly from a full distribution uniform 
# distribution from 0 to 1. How many samples will we need to take? 
# Let's try a few options and see how well they do

par(mfrow=c(3,2))
hist(rnorm(10))
hist(rnorm(100))
hist(rnorm(1000))
hist(rnorm(10000))
hist(rnorm(20000))

# Now let's plot the sample sizes against the variance of the sample distribution

plot(
    c(10,100,1000,10000,50000,100000),
    c(var(rnorm(10)), var(rnorm(100)), var(rnorm(1000)), var(rnorm(10000)), 
      var(rnorm(50000)), var(rnorm(100000))),
    ylab = "variance", main = "Variance of sampled normal"
    )
abline(h = 1)

# Let's now use 100 samples to see the difference between a Monte Carlo 
# sampling and a LHS sampling approach.
# Pick some small number of samples
n <- 100

# First we're going to sample 100 times from a random sample
mc_unif <- runif(n)

# 100 lh samples across 1 parameter
latin_unif <- randomLHS(n, 1)

# plot these two distribution
dev.off()
par(mfrow=c(3,2))
hist(mc_unif)
hist(latin_unif)

# You can see how the Latin Hypercube does a great job of sampling evenly 
# across the distribution. Let's now sample from a Normal distribution using 
# a random monte carlo sample across the whole distribution.
mc_norm <- rnorm(n, mean = 0, sd = 1)

# How do we sample using an LHS? We use the previous numbers generated from the 
# uniform LHS to draw samples from the Normal using the Inverse Cumulative 
# Sampling.
latin_norm <- qnorm(latin_unif, mean = 0, sd = 1)

# plot these two normal distributions
hist(mc_norm)
hist(latin_norm)

# the latin hypercube sample looks much better! Why does this work?
# first let's look at the norm probability distibution
x <- seq(-6, 6, by = 0.1) # random variable X
normdens <- dnorm(x, mean = 0, sd = 1) # prob distribution, f(X)
normcumul <- pnorm(x, mean = 0, sd = 1) # cumulative distribution, F(X)

plot(x, normdens, "l")
plot(x, normcumul, "l")

# Most of the density is in the middle range of values (-1 to 1).

# So we want a method to sample from this more often than the other areas in 
# the distribution. Specifically, we want to sample values from X proportionally 
# to the probability of those values occuring. Let's generate some samples 
# between 0-1. These can be values on our Y-axis. Then, if we ask what is the 
# value of the cumulative distribution that corresponds to these uniform 
# values we are taking the inverse for illustration let's just choose 10 points.
ex_latin <- randomLHS(10, 1)

# which X values are given by using these as the Y value (denoted by "X"s)?
abline(h = ex_latin, col = "red")
points(qnorm(ex_latin, mean = 0, sd = 1), y=rep(0,10), pc = "x")

# You can see that the samples are clustered around the middle: in areas of X 
# with higher density, the gradient of the cumluative distribution (F(X)) will 
# be very steep, causing more values between 0 and 1 to map to this range of X 
# with high density That is, F\^{-1}(R) = X where R is a uniform random number 
# between 0 and 1.

# So, you can sample from any distribution whose cumluative function is 
# 'invertable' by plugging in uniform random numbers to the inverse cumulative 
# function of your new distribution. For more information check out: 
# https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Inverse_transform_sampling

# Likewise, to perform LHS on a uni- or mulitvariate non-uniform distribution, 
# we can transform our LHS samples from a uniform distribution as above.
